有去澳洲的想法，PTE 是一个标准化考试，更偏向应试一点，短时间学习也能拿到不错的分数，就选它了。

## 口语

### RA

40s准备时间，在bi声后开始说。

准备时间利用起来，大声读一遍，把单词发音理顺。

流利度是最关键的因素。按照一致的速率读下来，不需要在意意群的重弱读。猩际的打分项里面重点看发音和流畅度是不是高的。流畅度这里注意，猩际app里面的分数是百分比，也就是说很多人可能读的很快来拉高流畅度，但是这也意味着正常读的话就会比较低的流畅度。所以不要纠结。

### RS

听一句话，然后复述。不能完全记住的话，提高流利度和发音也能得到高分。

258法则，至少说对四个实词，否则分数低于50分。

技巧：只复述前半句话。

练法：猩际mp3平时磨耳朵，刷题先刷高频，还可以分长短句，短句要100%听懂，长句至少听懂4个单词以上。顺序也很重要，前中后都能听出一两个单词，前后顺序不能换。把不会的难句收藏，重复听。

### DI / RL

#### DI

DI不扣语法。

1. 单线条

数据题:

- According to the image, the lowest value is found in xxx（点）, which is xxx(值）

另外，如果数据有多条线，也只抓住一条线描述！标题太长的话，节选，不然会影响后面速度。

RL技巧：捕捉关键词，造短语。比如关键词是system，主题词是energy, 造词： the system of energy. 

记得在纸上记下。

#### RL 模板：

- The talk was about ...
- The speaker first mentioned ...
- Moving on, the speaker mentioned ...

Nowadays, many headlines hit the newspaper on the topic of sports salaries. The issue has sparked a huge debate on whether sports salaries are too high. From my own point of view, I believe that sports salaries are not high.

On the one hand, there are numerous solid reasons why sports salaries are not high. Such as sport is becoming more and more popular and more and more organized. Although potentially positive impacts of sports high salaries should be taken into account, I still reckon that sports salary has, in many ways, enormously enriched people's lives. For instance, a well-known American scientist once said that sports salaries are not high, and could make our lives more efficient.

On the other hand, those who argue against sports salaries have a different opinion. In the first place, it can be claimed that sports salary is important. In the second place, as far as society is concerned, the ultimate aim of society is to shape young people into responsible people in the future. As a result, local governments and international organizations should make a joint effort to make sure that this situation will develop in the right direction.

In a nutshell, while there are many strong arguments on both sides, I still firmly believe that sports salary is not high.
